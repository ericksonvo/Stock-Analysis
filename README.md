# Stock-Analysis for Green Energy Companies
This stock analysis will look at multiple green energy companies including DAQO

It will look at total daily volume and & total return percentage 
for green stocks companies for the year 2018 to show which stocks had the most success.

Additionally it will look at VBA run scripts of
an origanl code and a refactored code and the compare the two for which code executed faster.

  The chart above shows the green energy companies and its tickers in 2018. In 2018, companies ENPH and RUN had a positive outcome for returns.
With ENPH having a total return of 81.9% and RUN having a total return of 84%. Companies that did the worst were DQ, JKS, SPWR, FSLR, and HASI.
These companies had the largest negative total return. Judgeing by this data investing in ENPH and RUN would have the most succcess.

  The chart above also shows VBA run scripts times of an original code and a refactored code. Comparing the two codes, the original code executed a lot 
slower than the refacotred one. We have a run time of 48487.95 seconds vs .0234375 seconds. This shows that refactoring a code can have substantial great results in executing a code.

# Summary
  
The advantages of refractoring an code is that you can make the code more organized and efficient (background Module 2 Challenge). making an code more organize can make it more easily read by other users. Also, it can make a code execute faster as we saw in this module challegne some disadvantages of refacotring a code is that it can be a bit messy if we are not fimiliar with the data set or the code can get ruined all together if refactoring is done improperly.

The advantages of the original code is that if some coders are not fimiliar with uses lists or arrays , the original code can be more easily read. However, in the refactored code it used arrays for the codes and this made it execute the code more quickly and it also made it look for easy on the eyes. Some disadvantages of the original code would be it has many layers to the coding, this can make it look messy and hard to read. While, the refactored code looked more organize and tiddy, during the refactoring there are more variables involves , so inputing them in the correct order and spots can be very difficult.
